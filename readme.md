# TfL bus route estimated speed and variability real-time visualisation

This repository defines a multi-container app that uses open data from TfL's 
unified API to estimate bus speeds and variability in (near) real-time and 
generates network plots using the [vizent library](https://github.com/cusp-london/vizent).
